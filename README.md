<h1> Penny Pincher </h1>
<h3> Android Application </h3>
<p> Have you ever been in a store and saw that an item was discounted? Ever wonder what the price was?
Some people may like spending time to calculate this in their head but for the rest of us, there's Penny Pincher.
Penny Pincher allows for users to enter in the price of the item and the discount amount. Upon the pressing of a button
<strong>poof!</strong> it's like magic: You now know the price of your item. <p>

<p> Currently this application supports the entering of a price and discount amount.<br>
For future versions I would like to add:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Additional discounts from coupons and so forth</li>
  <li> Total price with tax included </li>
  <li> Ability to calculate the cheapest option using price per unit (e.g. 0.04 cents per q-tip) </li>
</ul>

<p> If you have any ideas you would like to add or would like to contribute, feel free to contact me!</p>
